## Academic integrity

&gt; To uphold the Duke Community Standard:

&gt; - I will not lie, cheat, or steal in my academic endeavors;
&gt; - I will conduct myself honorably in all my endeavors; and
&gt; - I will act if the Standard is compromised.

---

## Collaboration policy


- Only work that is clearly assigned as team work should be completed collaboratively (Homework). 

- On take home exams you may not directly share or discuss code with anyone other than the Professor and TAs

- On homeworks you may not directly share code with other team(s) in this class, however you are welcome to discuss the problems together and ask for advice


---

## Sharing / reusing code policy

- I am well aware that a huge volume of code is available on the web to solve any number of problems.

- Unless I explicitly tell you not to use something the course's policy is that you may make use of any online resources (e.g. Google, StackOverflow, etc.) but you must explicitly cite where you obtained any code you directly use (or use as inspiration). 

- Any recycled code that is discovered and is not explicitly cited will be treated as plagiarism.
