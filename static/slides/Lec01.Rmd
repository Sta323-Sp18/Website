# (Almost) Everything is a Vector

---

## Types of vectors

The fundamental building block of data in R are vectors (collections of related values, objects, other data structures, etc).

<br/>

R has two fundamental vector classes:

* Vectors (atomic vectors) 

    - collections of values that are all of the *same* type (e.g. all logical values, all numbers, or all character strings).

* Lists (generic vectors)
  
    - collections of *any* type of R object, even other lists (meaning they can have a hierarchical/tree-like structure).

---

## Atomic Vectors

R has six atomic vector types: 

|  typeof    |   mode    | storage.mode 
|:-----------|:----------|:-------------
| logical    | logical   | logical      
| double     | numeric   | double       
| integer    | numeric   | integer      
| character  | character | character    
| complex    | complex   | complex      
| raw        | raw       | raw          

<br/>

For now we'll mainly worry about the first type, we'll discuss the following three next time (last two almost never come up).

## Logical (boolean) operations

|  Operator  |  Operation    |  Vectorized? 
|:-----------|:--------------|:-------------
| <code>x &#124; y</code>    |  or           |   Yes        
| `x & y`    |  and          |   Yes        
| `!x`       |  not          |   Yes        
| <code>x &#124;&#124; y</code> |  or           |   No         
| `x && y`   |  and          |   No         
|`xor(x,y)`  |  exclusive or |   Yes        


---
class: split-50

## Vectorized?

```{r}
x = c(TRUE,FALSE,TRUE)
y = c(FALSE,TRUE,TRUE)
```

.column[
```{r}
x | y
x || y
```
]

.column[
```{r}
x & y
x && y
```
]


---
class: split-50

## Length coercion

```{r}
x = c(TRUE,FALSE,TRUE)
y = c(TRUE)
z = c(FALSE,TRUE)
```

.column[
```{r}
x | y
y | z
```
]

.column[
```{r}
x & y
y & z
```
]

```{r}
x | z
```

---

## Comparisons

  Operator  |  Comparison                |  Vectorized?
:-----------|:---------------------------|:-----------------
 `x < y`    |  less than                 |  Yes
 `x > y`    |  greater than              |  Yes
 `x <= y`   |  less than or equal to     |  Yes
 `x >= y`   |  greater than or equal to  |  Yes
 `x != y`   |  not equal to              |  Yes
 `x == y`   |  equal to                  |  Yes
 `x %in% y` |  contains                  |  Yes (for `x`)


---
class: split-50 

## Comparisons

```{r}
x = c("A","B","C")
z = c("A")
```

.column[
```{r}
x == z
x != z
x > z
```
]

.column[
```{r}
x %in% z
z %in% x
```
]
 

---

## Conditional Control Flow

Conditional execution of code blocks is achieved via `if` statements. 

*Note that `if` statements are **not** vectorized.*

```{r}
x = c(3,1)

if (3 %in% x)
  "Here!"
if (x >= 2)
  "Now Here!"
```

---
class: split-50

## Collapsing logical vectors

There are a couple of helper functions for collapsing a logical vector down to a single value: `any`, `all`

```{r}
x = c(3,4)
```

.column[
```{r}
any(x >= 2)
all(x >= 2)
```
]

.column[
```{r}
!any(x >= 2)
if (any(x >= 2))
    print("Now There!")
```
]


---

## Nesting Conditionals

```{r}
x = 3
if (x < 0) {
  "Negative"
} else if (x > 0) {
  "Positive"
} else {
  "Zero"
}
```

```{r}
x = 0
if (x < 0) {
  "Negative"
} else if (x > 0) {
  "Positive"
} else {
  "Zero"
}
```

# Error Checking

---

## `stop` and `stopifnot`

Often we want to validate user input or function arguments - if our assumptions are not met then we often want to report the error and stop execution. 

```{r error=TRUE}
ok = FALSE
if (!ok)
  stop("Things are not ok.")

stopifnot(ok)
```

*Note - an error (like the one generated by `stop`) will prevent an RMarkdown document from compiling unless `error=TRUE` is set for that code block.*

---

## Style choices

```{r eval=FALSE}
# Do stuff
if (condition_one) {
  ##
  ## Do stuff
  ##
} else if (condition_two) {
  ##
  ## Do other stuff
  ##
} else if (condition_error) {
  stop("Condition error occured")
}
```

```{r eval=FALSE}
# Do stuff better
if (condition_error) {
  stop("Condition error occured")
}

if (condition_one) {
  ##
  ## Do stuff
  ##
} else if (condition_two) {
  ##
  ## Do other stuff
  ##
}
```

---

## Exercise 1

Write a set of conditional(s) that satisfies the following requirements,

* If `x` is greater than 3 and `y` is less than or equal to 3 then print "Hello world!"

* Otherwise if `x` is greater than 3 print "!dlrow olleH"

* If `x` is less than or equal to 3 then print "Something else ..."

* Stop execution if x is odd and y is even and report an error, don't print any of the text strings above.


Test out your code by trying various values of `x` and `y`.

# Loops

---

## `for` loops

Simplest, and most common type of loop in R - given a vector iterate through the elements and evaluate the code block for each.


```{r}
for(x in 1:10)
{
  cat(x^2,"")
}
```

```{r}
for(y in list(1:3, LETTERS[1:7], c(TRUE,FALSE)))
{
  cat(length(y),"")
}
```

---

## `while` loops

Repeat until the given condition is **not** met (i.e. evaluates to `FALSE`)

```{r}
i = 1
res = rep(NA,10)

while (i <= 10) {
  res[i] = i^2
  i = i+1
}

res
```

---

## `repeat` loops

Repeat until `break`

```{r}
i = 1
res = rep(NA,10)

repeat {
  res[i] = i^2
  i = i+1
  if (i > 10)
    break
}

res
```

---
class: split-50

## Special keywords - `break` and `next`

These are special actions that only work *inside* of a loop

* `break` - ends the current *loop* (inner-most)
* `next` - ends the current *iteration*

.column[
```{r}
for(i in 1:10) {
    if (i %% 2 == 0)
        break
    cat(i,"")
}
```
]

.column[
```{r}
for(i in 1:10) {
    if (i %% 2 == 0)
        next
    cat(i,"")
}
```
]


---
class: split-50

## Some helper functions

Often we want to use a loop across the indexes of an object and not the elements themselves. There are several useful functions to help you do this: `:`, `length`, `seq`, `seq_along`, `seq_len`, etc.

```{r}
4:7
length(4:7)
seq(4,7,by=1)
seq_along(4:7)
seq_len(length(4:7))
```

---

## Exercise 2

Below is the list of primes between 2 and 100:
```
2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 
43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97
```

If you were given the vector `x = c(3, 4, 12, 19, 23, 48, 50, 61, 63, 78)`, write out the R code necessary to print only the values of `x` that are *not* prime (without using subsetting or the `%in%` operator). 

Your code should use *nested* loops to iterate through the vector of primes and `x`.

# Functions

---

## When to use functions

The goal of a function should be to encapsulate a *small* *reusable* piece of code.

* Name should make it clear what the function does (think in terms of simple verbs).

* Functionality should be simple enough to be quickly understood.

* The smaller and more modular the code the easier it will be to reuse elsewhere.

* Better to change code in one location than code everywhere.

---

## Function Parts

The two parts of a function are the arguments (`formals`) and the code (`body`).

```{r}
gcd = function(long1, lat1, long2, lat2) {
  R = 6371 # Earth mean radius in km
  # distance in km
  acos(sin(lat1)*sin(lat2) + cos(lat1)*cos(lat2) * cos(long2-long1)) * R
}

formals(gcd)
body(gcd)
```

---

## Return values

There are two approaches to returning values: explicit and implicit return values.

*Explicit* - includes one or more `return` statements

```{r}
f = function(x) {
  return(x*x)
}
```

<br/>

*Implicit* - value of the last statement is returned.

```{r}
f = function(x) {
  x*x
}
```

---

## Returning multiple values

If we want a function to return more than one value we can group things using either vectors or lists.

```{r}
f = function(x) {
  c(x, x^2, x^3)
}

f(2)
f(2:3)
```

---
class: split-50

## Argument names

When defining a function we are also implicitly defining names for the arguments, when calling the function we can use these names to pass arguments in a different order.


```{r}
f = function(x,y,z) {
  paste0("x=",x," y=",y," z=",z)
}
```

.column[
```{r,error=TRUE}
f(1,2,3)
f(z=1,x=2,y=3)
```
]

.column[
```{r,error=TRUE}
f(y=2,1,3)
f(y=2,1,x=3)
```
]

```{r,error=TRUE}
f(1,2,3,m=1)
```

---

## Argument defaults

It is also possible to give function arguments default values so that they don't need to be provided every time the function is called.

```{r error=TRUE}
f = function(x,y=1,z=1) {
  paste0("x=",x," y=",y," z=",z)
}
```

```{r error=TRUE}
f()
f(x=3)
f(y=2,2)
```

---

## Scope

R has generous scoping rules, if it can't find a variable in the functions body, it will look for it in the next higher scope, and so on.

```{r}
y = 1
f = function(x) {
  x+y
}
f(3)
```

```{r}
g = function(x) {
  y=2
  x+y
}
g(3)
```

---

## 

Additionally, variables defined within a scope only persist for the duration of that scope, and do not overwrite variables at a higher scopes (unless you use the global assignment operator `<<-`, *which you shouldn't*)

```{r}
x = 1
y = 1
z = 1
f = function()
{
    y = 2
    g = function()
    {
      z = 3
      return(x + y + z)
    }
    return(g())
}
f()
c(x,y,z)
```

---

## Exercise 3

What is the output of the following code? Explain why.

```{r eval=FALSE}
z = 1

f = function(x,y,z)
{
  z = x+y

  g = function(m=x,n=y)
  {
    m/z + n/z
  }

  z * g()
}

f(1,2,3)
```

---

## Lazy evaluation

Arguments to R functions are lazily evaluated - meaning they are not evaluated until they are used 

```{r, error=TRUE}
f = function(x)
{
  cat("Hello world!\n")
  x
}

f(stop())
```

---

## Everything is a function

```{r}
`+`
typeof(`+`)
x = 4:1
`+`(x,2)
```

---

## Getting Help

Prefixing any function name with a `?` will open the related help file for that function.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
?`+`
?sum
```

For functions not in the base package, you can generally see their implementation by entering the function name without parentheses (or using the `body` function).

```{r}
lm
```

---

## Less Helpful Examples

```{r}
list

`[`

sum

`+`
```
